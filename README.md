# HelloApples	

Structure:

The app is being provisioned on AKS, using 2 single poded (for the moment) deployments,
**first** of which is the Mongo DB mounting the data from the **data.json** file and 
**the second** is the node.js app itself that simply presents the webpage on the provisioned address 
using one argument from the "fruits" collection to ensure successfull connection.

Note that there are two stages of provision: one to create the resources on AKS
and the other (running the script) to setup the app itself.

Instructions follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the provision of the Apples app it is assumed that you have the environment set: 
* Azure subscription with a service principal which has the rights to create and manage AKS
* Terraform installed on your system
* kubectl command line utils
  

! Note that the script should be executes on Powershell (tested on 5.1) with execution policy enabled and the required libraries installed!

For successfully provisioning the application, follow the steps below:
1.  Select the desired folder to work from and run **git init**. 
2.  Get the files from **"https://github.com/Andreyji/HelloApples.git new"**.
3.  Fill up the subscription_id, client_id, client_secret and tenant_id of your registered app and Azure subscription details
    in the vars.tf file.
4.  Execute **terraform init** then **terraform plan** in the local directory to which the repo is pulled.
5.  Run **terraform apply** to provision the resources on your Azure subscription.
6.  Execute **script.ps1** for running the application.
7.  Enjoy!
